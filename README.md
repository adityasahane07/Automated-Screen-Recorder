# Automated-Screen-Recorder

ScreenRecorder
This Python script captures your screen and saves it as a video file using PyAutoGUI and OpenCV. The script continuously takes screenshots, converts them to a video stream, and writes the output to a file. The user can control the recording by pressing 'q' to stop. This is a simple tool for creating screen recordings with customizable resolution, codec, and frame rate.

Features:

Cross-platform screen recording (Windows, macOS, Linux). Adjustable recording parameters (resolution, codec, frame rate). Real-time display of the recording screen (optional). User-friendly termination with the 'q' key. Adjustable Resolution: Specify the resolution of the screen recording. Video Codec: Choose the video codec for the output file. Timestamped File Names: Each recording is saved with a timestamped filename for easy identification. Frame Rate Control: Customize the frames per second (fps) for the recorded video.

Usage:

Install the required Python packages (pip install pyautogui opencv-python numpy). Run the script. Press 'q' to stop recording.

Feel free to customize and integrate this script into your projects!
